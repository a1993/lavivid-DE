It is alsocharacterized as an agent with low re-emission.","is_html":false}},"faq_item_8ddGai":{"type":"faq_item","settings":{"question":"Why \"Zeomic?\"","answer":"As more and more emphasis is placed on the peace-of-mind and safety of people, the functions and roles demanded of antimicrobial agents are diversifying.

In addition to antimicrobial effects, Zeomic also provides an odor-eliminating effect.","is_html":false}},"faq_item_dfJEfe":{"type":"faq_item","settings":{"question":"Can silver-base inorganic antimicrobial agent be bad for your health?","answer":"Sinanen Zeomic has various safety tests conducted by public specialized testing institutes. They have the highest level safety data.\n\nSilver-based inorganic antimicrobial agents, when used appropriately and in controlled concentrations, are generally considered safe for most people. Silver has been used for its antimicrobial properties for centuries, and it is a common ingredient in various products like wound dressings, medical devices, and even in some water purification systems.","is_html":false}},"faq_item_zQDgCz":{"type":"faq_item","settings":{"question":"Do silver-based antimicrobial products feel rough or stiff?","answer":"In our opinion you can not tell the difference between everyday, hair toppers, wigs, toupees, hair extenstions etc and our silver-based antimicrobial hair products. You will hardly notice any difference in use or appearance. Advancements in technology and manufacturing processes have allowed for more refined and subtle incorporation of silver-based antimicrobial agents. In many cases, the addition of these agents is designed to be as unobtrusive as possible, both in terms of appearance and texture.","is_html":false}},"faq_item_wWe6Cg":{"type":"faq_item","settings":{"question":"Will the Silver ever wash off?","answer":"No. Zeomic is a fine inorganic compound which will not dissolve in water or organic solvent however it can disperse.The silver particles will be attached by dipping, spraying, or brushing.It may then undergo a curing process, which can involve heat treatment to ensure the silver particles are securely bonded to the base.Then depending on the application, a sealing or protective layer may be applied to enhance the durability and longevity of the silver coating.","is_html":false}},"faq_item_44Vcfe":{"type":"faq_item","settings":{"question":"Does Zeomic help control odors in the hair systems and wigs?\"","answer":"Zeomic's odor-eliminating mechanisms are chemisorption and physisorption therefore once saturated it will no longer be capable of eliminating odor.
