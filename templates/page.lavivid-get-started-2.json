Which hair system is most breathable for an active lifestyle?","answer":"Full lace hair systems are the most breathable and lightweight styles. We also have combined\n                            bases of lace and skin, which are also breathable and easy to apply and remove. We recommend\n                            you remove the hair system and do a thorough clean once a week if you sweat a lot every day.","is_html":false}},"faq_item_WAcWF4":{"type":"faq_item","settings":{"question":"2. Which base provides the most secure attachment?","answer":"If bonded correctly, all our hair systems provide you with a secure attachment. If you care\n                            for your hair system properly (by removing, cleaning, and re-bonding every 2-4 weeks), it\n                            will stay secure. Nevertheless, many clients report the best experience with the full skin\n                            base. You need to apply liquid adhesive all over the scalp before wearing a full skin base\n                            hair system for the most secure fit.","is_html":false}},"faq_item_KaemD4":{"type":"faq_item","settings":{"question":"3. Will a hair system damage my scalp?","answer":"It will not damage your scalp or existing hair, provided the hair system is kept clean and maintained correctly. The hair system may actually provide protection against the sun and shield sensitive scalps from the elements.","is_html":false}},"faq_item_8bKqC7":{"type":"faq_item","settings":{"question":"4. How long until I receive my hair system after ordering?","answer":"It depends on your location and the hair systems you ordered. The delivery time includes order processing and shipping time. Our stock hair systems require 3-4 business days for processing, while a custom order takes around 6 weeks. For US orders, we use USPS and FedEx, which take about 7 days. For international orders, shipping usually takes 6-12 business days. We cannot guarantee shipping times during national crises, holidays, or other unforeseen delays.","is_html":false}},"faq_item_xPpthP":{"type":"faq_item","settings":{"question":"5. How often should I replace my hair system?","answer":"It mainly depends on which base you choose, as different bases have different lifespans. Our ultra-thin skin base (0.03mm) lasts about 2 months, while our mono base can last up to a year with the right care. Additionally, how often you wear it and how you maintain your hair system also affect its lifespan.","is_html":false}},"faq_item_7kXfya":{"type":"faq_item","settings":{"question":"6. Can I swim, shower, or sleep with my hair system on?","answer":"Yes, you can sleep, swim, and shower with it on without any issues. However, chlorine in pools can be harmful and make the hair drier, so we recommend deep conditioning the hair after swimming to help refresh it.","is_html":false}},"faq_item_LzCBhk":{"type":"faq_item","settings":{"question":"7. What adhesive is best for swimming?","answer":"If your hair is frequently exposed to water, use waterproof tape or adhesives. Acrylic adhesives (Ultra Hold) or Blue Liner Lace tape work well for secure attachment.","is_html":false}},"faq_item_QA8fxK":{"type":"faq_item","settings":{"question":"8. How long can I keep the hair system bonded?","answer":"The bonding time depends on factors like the adhesive used, your skin type, the climate, and your lifestyle. We recommend removing and cleaning it every 1-2 weeks to extend its lifespan. If you don’t sweat a lot and live in a dry climate, you can leave it on for about 3-4 weeks. If you attach a lace hair system with liquid adhesive, we don’t recommend wearing it for more than two weeks to avoid difficulty in cleaning.","is_html":false}},"faq_item_BYaqmf":{"type":"faq_item","settings":{"question":"9. Any tips for removing tape from my lace base?","answer":"Before removing the lace hair system, apply spray adhesive remover to the tape area and soak it for several minutes. Find the edge of the base in the back and lift it slightly, then use a towel to gently remove the tapes.","is_html":false}},"faq_item_iCtRKh":{"type":"faq_item","settings":{"question":"10. Will the lace match my skin tone?","answer":"The lace color of all stock hair systems is beige. If you need the lace in other colors, please contact our customer service at support@lavividhair.com for customization.","is_html":false}},"faq_item_iyhrQB":{"type":"faq_item","settings":{"question":"11. Do you offer customization services?","answer":"Yes, we do. We provide a convenient individual service to create the most suitable hair system based on your specific needs. You can choose the hair material, color, texture, density, base construction, size, shape, and hair direction for a perfect match.","is_html":false}},"faq_item_X4VAkm":{"type":"faq_item","settings":{"question":"12. Can I customize density in different base sections?","answer":"Yes, many customers order lighter density in the front hairline for a natural graduated appearance. We can also offer a lighter density around the perimeter to blend seamlessly with your hair.","is_html":false}}},"block_order":["faq_item_QXPzJK","faq_item_WAcWF4","faq_item_KaemD4","faq_item_8bKqC7","faq_item_xPpthP","faq_item_7kXfya","faq_item_LzCBhk","faq_item_QA8fxK","faq_item_BYaqmf","faq_item_iCtRKh","faq_item_iyhrQB","faq_item_X4VAkm"],"name":"[gy] FAQ","settings":{"faq_title":"FAQ","faq_subtitle":"","enable_schema":true}}},"order":["main","common_banner_rwRbnb","custom_content_N9eepn","flash_sale_wkrki7","common_heading_gTiXrE","video_tips_list_Npt8z6","video_tips_list_jfrdxh","faq_Ge76UD"]}
