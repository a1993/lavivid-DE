We recommend you only remove it and get it cleaned every 1-2 weeks to extend the lifespan of the hair system. If you don't sweat a lot and live in a dry climate, you can leave it on for a longer time, about 2-4 weeks. If you attach a lace hair system with liquid adhesive, we don't recommend you to wear it for more than two weeks in a row. If you wear it for too long time, the adhesive will penetrate through the lace which makes it very difficult to clean.<\/p>","is_html":false}},"faq_maintenance_03":{"type":"faq_item","settings":{"question":"I have problems with removing the tape from the lace base of my hair system. Do you have any tips for this?","answer":"<p>Before removing the lace hair system from the scalp, apply the spray adhesive remover to the area where the tape is and soak the tape for several minutes. Find the edge of the base in the back and lift it a little. Then use a towel to remove the tapes gently.<\/p>","is_html":false}},"category_lifestyles":{"type":"category","settings":{"category_title":"Lifestyles","category_icon":"","category_description":""}},"faq_lifestyles_01":{"type":"faq_item","settings":{"question":"Can I swim, shower, or sleep with my hair system on?","answer":"<p>Yes.
