            "answer": "<p> Hybrid hair systems combine lace and skin to bring out the best of both materials. For instance, our Simois hair system features a central lace base for a soft, breathable feel, paired with thin PU skin along the perimeter for easy attachment and removal, plus a front lace section for a natural, seamless hairline. Full skin systems, on the other hand, often use a V-loop technique at the front to achieve a realistic hairline. With thicker skin, they offer strong support for denser hair and excellent durability, typically lasting longer than hybrids, depending on the skin's thickness. </p>"
