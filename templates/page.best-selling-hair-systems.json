long will my hair system last?","answer":"It depends on the base design of the hair system and how well the wearer looks after their hair system. Thin skin base can usually last 2-4 months, depending on skin thickness. The thicker the skin, the longer the lifespan. Lace base and mono base can last 3-6 months, while silk base can last up to 9 months.","is_html":false}},"faq_item_VxV9N4":{"type":"faq_item","settings":{"question":"Can I swim, shower, or exercise while wearing a hair system?","answer":"Yes. A properly bonded hair system stays secure during swimming, showering, and workouts. Just use waterproof adhesive and follow the aftercare tips to keep it lasting longer.","is_html":false}},"faq_item_3VyHC8":{"type":"faq_item","settings":{"question":"How often do I need to remove and reapply a hair system?","answer":"Most men reapply every 2–4 weeks, depending on the adhesive, scalp condition, and lifestyle. Some prefer weekly maintenance for maximum comfort, while others can go longer with a strong waterproof adhesive.","is_html":false}},"faq_item_wd6XeR":{"type":"faq_item","settings":{"question":"Will the hair system look natural and undetectable?","answer":"Yes. Our quality hair system is designed to blend seamlessly with your natural hair. With the right base, color match, and hair density, even the front hairline can look completely natural and undetectable.","is_html":false}},"faq_item_PfaTPm":{"type":"faq_item","settings":{"question":"I'm looking for the most secure attachment. Which base shall I choose?","answer":"If bonded correctly, all of our hair systems can provide you with a secure attachment. If you care for your hair system properly (by removing, cleaning, and re-bonding every 1-2 weeks), it will stay securely. Nevertheless, if you are looking for the strongest attachment, many of our clients have the best experience with the full skin base. You need to apply liquid adhesive all over the scalp, which guarantees the most secure fit.","is_html":false}},"faq_item_mPwNxP":{"type":"faq_item","settings":{"question":"I work out a lot and spend most of my time sweating. Which system is the most breathable and suitable for a very active lifestyle?","answer":"Full lace hair systems are the most breathable and light-weight styles. We also have combined bases of lace which are also breathable and easy to apply and remove. We recommend you remove the hair system and do a thorough clean once a week if you sweat a lot.","is_html":false}}},"block_order":["faq_item_P6aPeA","faq_item_VxV9N4","faq_item_3VyHC8","faq_item_wd6XeR","faq_item_PfaTPm","faq_item_mPwNxP"],"name":"FAQ","settings":{"faq_title":"FAQ","faq_subtitle":"","enable_schema":true}}},"order":["main","common_heading_j3VcGC","custom_rich_text_KKgMVx","common_heading_zq3cK4","halloween_with_swiper_Gr4DXD","common_heading_DW8r7N","halloween_with_swiper_xxYPLQ","image_text_grid_Q9K6Ub","faq_QEqmJi"]}
